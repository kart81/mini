# ⏰ Mini Projects – Clock & To-Do List

A collection of simple beginner-friendly JavaScript projects demonstrating time display, DOM manipulation, and basic local storage usage.

---

## 📌 Projects Included

---

### 1️⃣ **Digital Clock (clock.html)**

A real-time digital clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

#### **Features**

* Displays current **time** and **date**
* Updates every second
* Simple, clean, and responsive UI

#### **How it Works**

The clock uses JavaScript’s `Date()` object to fetch and update time every second with `setInterval()`.

---

### 2️⃣ **To-Do List App (todolist.html)**

A lightweight task manager that stores tasks directly in the browser using Local Storage.

#### **Features**

* Add new tasks
* Mark tasks as completed
* Delete tasks
* Tasks saved automatically using **LocalStorage**
* Simple and beginner-friendly interface

#### **How it Works**

Tasks are saved as an array in the browser’s Local Storage, so they stay even after refreshing the page.
